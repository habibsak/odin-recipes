  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>An indulgence of fries, gravy and cheese. A Canadian specialty!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>1 (10.25 ounce) can beef gravy</li>
    <li>5 medium potatoes, cut into fries</li>
    <li>2 cups cheese curds</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). While the oil is heating, you can begin to warm your gravy.</li>
    <li>Place the fries into the hot oil, and cook until light brown, about 5 minutes. Make the fries in batches if necessary to allow them room to move a little in the oil. Remove to a paper towel lined plate to drain.</li>
    <li>Place the fries on a serving platter, and sprinkle the cheese over them. Ladle gravy over the fries and cheese, and serve immediately.</li>
